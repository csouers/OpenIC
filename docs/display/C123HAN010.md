### Brightness Control Scheme - SQD-605 ver 3.2
This board uses a constant voltage (not PWM) for brightness control. We can replace the ADJ signal from the LCD main board with our own line to control brightness programmatically. We can also supplement this for a different driver altogether, just need to match the voltage and current specs.
- 2.4V - 100%
- 5V- 0% (Not off, just the lowest point. Should really be called 1% on the controller's menu)

There is an "On" pin adjacent to the ADJ pin on the board. Standard fair for controlling it here.
- 5.6V - On
- 0V - Off
