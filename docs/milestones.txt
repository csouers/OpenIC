- 1/21/2019 - qt5 cross compiling is working from a Ubuntu 16.04 VM. Was able to build the "dashboard" example from qtquickcontrols and run it on the pi.
- 1/22/2019 - boot screen setup. boot time is ~20 secs to dasboard. boot logo comes up at ~ 10 seconds. Boot logo shows if dashboard quits/dies. Working through display/controller issues. Think display's onboard processing is bad. Trying to swap or get another to test.
- 2/7/2019 - Ordered new display. New driver kit not ordered. Got MCP2515 working with Pi, though the pi will likely communicate with the board over SPI as to allow for universal communication with the project.
